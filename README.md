**Briefly summarize the requirements and goals of the app you developed. What user needs were this app designed to address?**\
The goal of the app was to provide warehouse workers and hobbyists with a quick and intuitive way to manage their inventory. The requirements were as follows: 

-   the app shall require logins.

-   the app shall display the name and quantity of all products.

-   the app shall provide the user with a means of adding a new item. 

-   the app shall provide the user with a means of altering the quantity of an already existing item.

-   the app shall provide a way to delete an item from the database. 

-   the app shall send a text message (SMS) to the user when inventory is low, if permission is granted.

**What screens and features were necessary to support user needs and produce a user-centered UI for the app? How did your UI designs keep users in mind? Why were your designs successful?**\
The primary features needed to support user needs were toolbars, a RecyclerView, a floating action button, buttons, and input fields. Ease of navigation was the primary concern for users of this app. Buttons were made large, and their purposes were made obvious through clear iconography. Toolbars were added specifically to keep screen-to-screen navigation consistent. I believe my design was successful because it prioritized simplicity and followed industry standards in UI design.

**How did you approach the process of coding your app? What techniques or strategies did you use? How could those techniques or strategies be applied in the future?**\
I approached the process of coding the app by determining what I needed the app to do, what features were required to accomplish that in an intuitive way, and what code patterns were best suited to implement those features. My primary strategy was to mirror textbook examples of the features I needed to implement and then modify them to best suit my app's requirements. That strategy can be generalized as learning from established examples and adapting them to fit the specific situation. I believe this approach can be applied to many high-skill fields, including computer science.

**How did you test to ensure your code was functional? Why is this process important, and what did it reveal**?

I tested the code by running it in an emulator and attempting all the functions I needed the user to be able to perform, including adding, updating, and deleting items, as well as verifying login functionality and SMS notifications. This process is important because it allows the developer to identify and correct bugs before deployment. My program did not boot successfully on the first run, which revealed issues that needed debugging and reinforced the importance of iterative testing.

**Consider the full app design and development process from initial planning to finalization. Where did you have to innovate to overcome a challenge?**\
While I did not implement any groundbreaking innovations, I had to problem-solve consistently throughout development by referencing the textbook, researching error messages, and applying best practices. 

**In what specific component of your mobile app were you particularly successful in demonstrating your knowledge, skills, and experience?**\
I believe my skills are best demonstrated in the design of the code. I aimed to keep it modular, consistent, and largely self-documenting through descriptive naming conventions and targeted commenting.
